| WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE   | Let the bird of loudest lay               | The Phoenix and the Turtle    | Renaissance   | Mythology & Folklore  |
|                       | On the sole Arabian tree                  |                               |               |                       |
|                       | Herald sad and trumpet be,                |   
|                       | To whose sound chaste wings obey.         |
|                       | But thou shrieking harbinger,             |
|                       | Foul precurrer of the fiend,              |
|                       | Augur of the fever's end,                 |
|                       | To this troop come thou not near.         |
|                       | From this session interdict               |
|                       | Every fowl of tyrant wing,                |
|                       | Save the eagle, feather'd king;           |
|                       | Keep the obsequy so strict.               |
|                       | Let the priest in surplice white,         |
|                       | That defunctive music can,                |
|                       | Be the death-divining swan,               |
|                       | Lest the requiem lack his right.          |
|                       | And thou treble-dated crow,               |
|                       | That thy sable gender mak'st              |
|                       | With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,   |
|                       | 'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.       
|                       | Here the anthem doth commence:        
|                       | Love and constancy is dead;
|                       | Phoenix and the Turtle fled
|                       | In a mutual flame from hence.
|                       | So they lov'd, as love in twain
|                       | Had the essence but in one;
|                       | Two distincts, division none:
|                       | Number there in love was slain.
|                       | Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
|                       | Distance and no space was seen
|                       | 'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:
|                       | But in them it were a wonder.
|                       | So between them love did shine
|                       | That the Turtle saw his right
|                       | laming in the Phoenix' sight:
|                       | Either was the other's mine.
|                       | Property was thus appalled
|                       | That the self was not the same;
|                       | Single nature's double name
|                       | Neither two nor one was called.
|                       | Reason, in itself confounded,
|                       | Saw division grow together,
|                       | To themselves yet either neither,
|                       | Simple were so well compounded;
|                       | That it cried, "How true a twain
|                       | Seemeth this concordant one!
|                       | Love has reason, reason none,
|                       | If what parts can so remain."
|                       | Whereupon it made this threne
|                       | To the Phoenix and the Dove,
|                       | Co-supremes and stars of love,
|                       | As chorus to their tragic scene:
|                       | threnos, Beauty, truth, and rarity,
|                       | Grace in all simplicity,
|                       | Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.
|                       | Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
|                       | And the Turtle's loyal breast
|                       | To eternity doth rest,
|                       | Leaving no posterity:
|                       | 'Twas not their infirmity,
|                       | It was married chastity.
|                       | Truth may seem but cannot be;
|                       | Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
|                       | Truth and beauty buried be.
|                       | To this urn let those repair
|                       | That are either true or fair;
